## vctl run

Run a new container from a container image.

### Synopsis

Create and start a container with the given name, from the specified container image, then run a command in it.
* Every container runs in a separate virtual machine (CRX VM), the virtual machine is created with the same name as the container and starts up when a container starts. It shuts down and is removed when the container stops.
* Use '--memory' and '--cpus' to make specific configurations to the CPU and memory that is available to the container.
* A container running in a virtual machine shares the memory with its hosting virtual machine. (e.g. Within a virtual machine with 1024MB memory, max memory available for the container will be 512MB, and rest of the memory are reserved for the operating system.)
* Use 'vctl system config' to manage the default settings of the virtual machine hosting container. (e.g. vctl system config --vm-mem 2048)
* If no COMMAND is provided, the default command from the image will be executed.
* When '--keepVM' is used, use 'vmrun stop VMX' to manually stop the host virtual machine before using the container again.

```

### Examples

```
  # To run a new container using 'myImage' image.
  vctl run myImage

  # To set environment variables "FOO=BAR" when running a new container using 'myImage' image.
  vctl run --env="FOO=BAR" myImage

  # To set 4 CPU cores limit and 2GB memory limit for a new container using 'myImage' image. (In this case the virtual machine hosting the container will be configured with 4 CPU cores and 2560MB memory.)
  vctl run -c 4 -m 2048 myImage

  # To run a new container in background. (detached from current terminal)
  vctl run --detach myImage

  # To assign name 'myContainer' to the new container to run.
  vctl run --name myContainer myImage

  # To keep the host virtual machine running after container stops for potential debug and troubleshooting needs.
  vctl run --keepVM myImage

  # To mount folder ~/Documents/toolchain on host to the new container using 'myImage' image.
  vctl run --volume ~/Documents/toolchain:/toolchain myImage
```

### Options

```

  -i, --interactive         Keep STDIN open even if not attached
      --keepVM              [EXPERIMENTAL] Keep the host virtual machine running after container stops
  -l, --label strings       Set additional labels to the container (e.g. foo=bar)
  -m, --memory int          Limit on memory available to the container (in MB, must be a multiple of 4) (default 512)
  -n, --name string         Assign a name to the container
  -r, --privileged          Run the container with extended privileges
  -p, --publish strings     Bind host network ports to container ports
