## vctl start

Start an existing container.

### Synopsis

Start a created or stopped container.
* Every container runs in a separate virtual machine, a virtual machine is created with the same name as the container and starts up when a container starts. It shuts down and is removed when the container stops.
* Use '--memory' and '--cpus' to make specific configurations to the CPU and memory available to the container.
* A container running in a virtual machine shares the memory with the operating system. (e.g. Within a virtual machine with 1024MB memory, max memory available for the container will be 512MB, and rest of the memory are reserved for the operating system.)
* Use 'vctl system config' to manage the default settings of the virtual machine hosting container. (e.g. vctl system config --vm-mem 2g)
* When '--keepVM' is used, use 'vmrun stop VMX' to manually stop the host virtual machine before using the container again.

```
vctl start [OPTIONS] CONTAINER
```

### Examples

```
  # To set 4 CPU cores limit and 2GB memory limit for myContainer. (In this case the virtual machine hosting the container will be configured with 4 CPU cores and 2560MB memory.)
  vctl start -c 4 -m 2g myContainer
```

### Options

```
  -c, --cpus int        Number of CPU cores (default 2)
  -d, --detach          Run the container in background
  -h, --help            Help for start
      --keepVM          [EXPERIMENTAL] Keep the host virtual machine running after container stops
  -m, --memory string   Limit on memory (MB/GB) available to the container (default "512m")
```
